# Learning  
## What is this repo?  
My adventures in learning new things, may it be rust, minimax, or chess programming.  
Eventually the projects in here might find a new repo to live in once they have a set goal, or reach a certain size in their codebase.  


## What are the projects?
 - [Minimax](Minimax)
 - [Algorithms](Algorithms\README.md)
 - [Chess](Chess\README.md)
## How do I run the projects?  
Well, for now use `cargo` to run the minimax implementation. 
```bash
cargo run # runs the debug build
carg run --release # runs the release build
```
