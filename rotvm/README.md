# rotvm (rvm for short)  
A light weight universal programming language vm made in rust.
## What is this  
You've probably heard of the JVM. Its become a platform for major languages in the industry, such as java, kotlin, scala, and compilers for well known languages such as jpython, and more.  
This is a vm designed to be a vm that can target existing os's, can compile to bare metal for os development, and more.  
## lofty goals!  
Yeah, most of them probably wont come into fruition, but you gotta start somewhere.  
## Goals
 - Become #[no-std] compilable
- Speed
- Fully tested code.
- No `unsafe` blocks
- Have a compiler toolchain
  - An assembler, and a compiler for a language.
- Documented bytecode and compiler workings.
